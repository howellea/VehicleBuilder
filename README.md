## Getting Started

### **Communication**

> Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.
> Paul J. Meyer

The most important element to your success is communication. You have a team of people ready to help. We need you to communicate.

Office hours and Slack are the best places to communicate with your instructinonal staff. You can reach out to Tish on Slack at anytime. You can expect a response within 24 hours. Most of the time it will be much faster.

Confused, but don't know what question to ask. That's ok. Sometimes it can be hard to articulate and all you know is that you are lost. Reach out anyways, we can figure it out together.
